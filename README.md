# String to beep-boop

## What it is

This is is a small and simple program that takes a string inputed by the user converts it to binary and plays a beep for 1's and boop for 0's.

## Changing the sound that plays

If you dont like the beep/boop sounds that I have used, you can change it by naming the file you want to be played to either beep or boop (depending if you want it to play on the 1 or 0 respectively) and move it to the sounds directory.
